## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to how differences in demographics correspond to mortality rates of various cancers. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
finaldata <- read_csv("finaldata4.csv")
```
```{r}
finaldata
```

```{r}
finaldata |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Race, y = Deceased)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

The massive disparities here can partially be attributed to the fact that the vast majority of people sample were white; it may be more informative to compare percentages instead of absolute number.
